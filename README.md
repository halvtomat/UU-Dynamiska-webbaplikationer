# UU-Dynamiska-webbaplikationer
Dynamiska webbaplikationer course at Uppsala University

This is a basic web-development course covering HTML, CSS and very basic Javascript.

Lab 1 (Uppgift 1) covers HTML

Lab 2 (Uppgift 2) covers CSS

Lab 3 (Uppgift 3) covers Javascript

Lab 4 (Uppgift 4) is a test of Kjell.com/se, does it follow W3 standards and is it accessible

Project (Projekt) is a mix of all the previous labs
I got a functionality-specification, some images and text and was supposed to create a website based on that.
